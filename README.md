Hey there! I'm 100PC,
Im here to prove that you can use enough free services to do whatever you want without downloading a single file to your personal device!
Can't wait to chat and hear out suggestions or solutions about 100% digital personal devices
(Currently im mostly focussed on 100% online devices for developers. So I will be using visual studio, Google Drive and Github alot)
Can't wait to to meet you!
